# TheGameOfObstacles
Players must make it to the green disc, the exit point. If they are shot, hit by an enemy, or pierced by a trap, they die.

The player is controlled using the keyboard. The player model is moved by directly via its transform. It gains velocity as movement keys are held down, up to a maximum velocity.
It can also dash for a temporary boost.

Enemies can shoot projectiles that kill the player as soon as the player collides with the projectile. Some enemies themselves kill the player as soon as the player collides with them. 
Enemies stand still, or walk a predetermined path.
A trap raises and lowers spikes that also kill the player on the spot so long as the spikes are raising when the player is standing on the trap.

The game has just one level, but more could be added.

Controls: WASD (movement), space (jump).
