# UnityPlayground
This repository is meant for projects we will create to **try, learn, and play with Unity**.
Some projects may follow or, at least, be inspired by, a book, a tutorial, or a class; some
may be the result of our imagination; some may be a combination of the previous two.


If you happen to land here, consider that these projects may well not follow good
programming practices. Rather, assume they are like a quick, incomplete, sketch.

## Projects
- The Game of Obstacles, [link](https://github.com/tlundgren/unity_playground/blob/Projects/GameOfObstacles/readme.md).
The player must make it to the exit point. If they are hit or shot by an enemy, or pierced by a trap, they die.


## Disclaimer
If you use any piece of code, instruction, or guide here, you do it at your own risk.
